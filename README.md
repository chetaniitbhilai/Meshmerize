# Meshmerize
This project aims to develop a line-following robot capable of autonomously navigating through complex mazes. The robot employs sensor-based feedback to follow predefined paths and make decisions at intersections, solving the maze efficiently. 
The bot is also controlled using the PID control system to smooth maze navigation while following the line.
